# MLND Deep Learning Capstone

This project is done in the context of Udacity's Machine Learning Nano Degree
capstone project. The idea is to use deep learning, via tensorflow, to detect
Street View House Number.

## Source Code

The code is split into a couple of notebooks, where the data was fetched,
explored and the tensorflow model was trained. It is also provided a web
service that could be used to predict the house numbers.

## Requirements

This project requires **Python 3.0** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [TensorFlow](http://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [SciPy library](http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/index.html)
- [Six](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/six/)
- [h5py](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/h5py/)
- [Pillow](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow/)
- [Flask]()

[iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) is required to run the
jupyter notebooks.

## Run

Open `Ipython Notebook` in the root folder.

Open the 5 Files and run their contents one after the other.

## Data

This project uses the [The Street View House Numbers (SVHN) Dataset](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/).

SVHN is a real-world image dataset for developing machine learning and object
recognition algorithms with minimal requirement on data preprocessing and
formatting. It can be seen as similar in flavor to MNIST (e.g., the images are
of small cropped digits), but incorporates an order of magnitude more labeled
data (over 600,000 digit images) and comes from a significantly harder,
unsolved, real world problem (recognizing digits and numbers in natural scene
images). SVHN is obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images.
